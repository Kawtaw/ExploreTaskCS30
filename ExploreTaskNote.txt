c. Amazon has several different harmful and beneficial effects. When people uses Amazon to purchase stuff online this becomes a huge benefit to society 
because it saves a person time and prevent the problem of having to goto physical store. Amazon gives you a huge selection of product to choose from, this 
allows people to easily find exactly what they want. The harmful effect of Amazon is that people are unable to see or touch the product physically before they 
purchase it. According to the artical by Jerri Collins the harmful effect is that when a person shop online, there's a risk that a hacker might be able to steal 
their credit card information. The privacy and security is a big issue with online shopping. Amazon dramatically changes our society. People are spending less 
time shopping at physical store. According to Taylor Knight article, 17% of people with brick-and-mortar stores have seen store sales decrease by 5% or more 
over the last two years. With people shopping online more often, physical store will slowly start decreasing. While Amazon brings a lot of advantages to society 
one must be aware of cybercriminal and must be really careful when shopping online.

d. According to Bernard Marr article, Amazon has a big data that it gathers from its million customer transactions. Everytime someone made a purchase on Amazon, 
a data is created about the type of items that the person is buying. Amazon uses these data to monitor their customer behavior and their buying habit. These data 
helps them understand what's relevant to the customer so they can advertise the right product to the right customer. Some of the data security concern in Amazon 
is privacy. Many customers are uncomfortable having their personal information collected such as their purchase history. With Amazon having access to our personal 
data, they can see which item are popular and which aren't. They can also see which items a certain group of people would buy which is pretty invasive. It is very 
difficult to avoid your data being collected unless you're willing to buy stuff at a physical store with physical cash.
